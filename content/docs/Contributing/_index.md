First off, we're glad you want to help!  The project team is kind and helpful, so if you're not sure if you have a good first contribution, make a [Discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/alguidelines/discussions/) about it or even just create your first try.  You'll get feedback and we will be happy to help refine it, if it even needs it.

## Code of Conduct

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.
